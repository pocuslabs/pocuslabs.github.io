              Hocus Pocus Labs LLC, or Pocus Labs for short, was founded in 2020 by me, <a href="https://austinpocus.com">Austin Pocus</a>. I love making things, and with Pocus Labs, I'm aiming for a different direction, more creative than consumptive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most software now is built for consumption, for you to scroll endlessly, eating your attention (and your drive to <em>do things</em>, to <em>make things</em>). I believe in building software that betters the world whenever possible, and that's not some BS Silicon Valley-style "changing the world" with...some new spreadsheet tool or whatever. No. I want to change the world for the better by empowering people to <em>create</em> things.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been writing code professionally for 10 years, and unprofessionally a lot longer. I started when I was 13 (without giving away my age, I'm old enough to remember dial-up, and my first PC ran Windows 98). I wanted to make games, but ended up making websites &mdash; c'est la vie. I've enjoyed it so far, to be completely honest, but it's time to shift gears here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pocus Labs is currently where my side projects are happening. Where the action is, so to speak. You can also read my blog at <a href="https://austinpocus.com">austinpocus.com</a> if you want semi-regular updates, technical esoterica, or just a good ol' internet rant. I'll eventually start blog.pocuslabs.com, but...not now.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eventual goal of Pocus Labs is to be the peaceful equivalent of Northrup Grumman or BBN or the other big research firms &mdash; pure R&D. I just won't build anything that is intentionally designed to hurt anyone. I especially want to pursue software and other digital experiences that help people create, or feel creative. <em>That's</em> the ultimate goal. I want your grandma to make stuff on the computer, and enjoy doing it!

                      Partnering with v1Labs, a <a href="https://twitter.com/duilen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@duilen</a> production, we have built a beta-level tool that compares two Twitter handles, finding the common handles that they both follow. With this tool, you could:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="regular-style">
                      <li class="benefit">Find influencers in a given field by comparing the people you already know</li>
                      <li class="benefit">Discover handles you might want to follow that your friends already follow</li>
                      <li class="benefit">Uncover hidden connections between famous people</li>
                      <li class="benefit">Learn how many degrees of separation there are between you and Obama</li>
                      <li class="benefit">Devise a more targeted, intentional marketing strategy</li>

                    <p class="after-benefits">
                      And so much more! The possibilities are only limited by your imagination! And of course, the capabilities of the app, but hey, what are we, wizards?
